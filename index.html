                     “I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”<br><br>

                        “You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
                        Love like you'll never be hurt,
                        Sing like there's nobody listening,
                        And live like it's heaven on earth.”<br><br>
                        ― William W. Purkey
